In PoolMyNFT, users deposit their NFTs (ERC-721) into collection-specific Pools and receive a standard ERC-20 token for each NFT deposited.

This enables users to utilize their Pool Tokens in various Ethereum-based decentralized finance applications.

Any user can deploy a Pool for a specific NFT collection, and the smart contracts ensure that each Pool NFT is fully backed by a corresponding NFT from its collection. The Pools allow for NFTs from the same collection to be interchangeable, and users can swap NFTs freely with each other.

However, it's not guaranteed that any particular NFT from a collection will be in the pool at any given time.

Pools are public and we don't charge any additional fee except gas fee.

The source code for the contracts are publicly available, but they have not been audited. Use at your own risk.
